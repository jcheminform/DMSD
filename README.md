# The diatomic molecular spectroscopic database

About the project:
The project aims to make available the spectroscopic constants for diatomic molecules as well as Franck-Condon factors (relevant for laser cooling of molecules) to the users, from students to researchers, in a friendly and completely interactive way. Friendly because the user can straightforwardly retrieve spectroscopic data of diatomic molecules in a variety of formats compatible with analyzing software. The user, after registration, has the possibility of uploading new spectroscopic data. Therefore the project prompts the field of molecular spectroscopy through the information era paradigm that we live these days.


The project has been developed under the open-access philosophy promoted by the Max Planck Society. Finally, we would like to emphasize that having more data helps to better understand the underlying quantum mechanical nature behind the scene of molecules.
